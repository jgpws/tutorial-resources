Fixes for OmNu-Champagne themes

GTK3/GTK2:
* Remove reference to gtk-dark.css, as there is no dark version
* In gtk-3.20 and gtk-3.0 folders, open both gtk.gresource.xml files and remove these lines -> <file>dist/gtk-dark.css</file>
* Then remove the files gtk-dark.css from both the top level (gtk-3.20) and dist folders
* In the gtk.css file, copy the top @import statement, and paste on a new line just below.
* Comment out the first line
* In the newly copied second line, point the import statement to just dist/gtk.css

* Open gtk3-widget-factory
* Hit Ctrl+Shift+d to open GTK Inspector

Menu
* Remove padding from menuitems; In GTK Inspector, click Select an object to select the top level menu item
* Go to Page 2 in gtk-widget-factory
* Navigate to the inner (dropdown) menu container -> menubar > menuitem > window > menu
* Note the padding values and their line location in gtk.css
* Find that line of CSS in your gtk.css file; change padding to 0
* Type accelerator into the searchbox of your text editor; look for the line that begins with menu menuitem:active accelerator (apprx. line 3626); change the color in this style rule to rgba(30, 31, 32, 0.6)

Dialog
* Click Select button on the same page
* Using GTK Inspector, click the on the button; In CSS nodes, note the line location in gtk.css
* Change the color for suggested-action labels to #1f1b15
* Change the color at approx. line 1749 to #000000; this is the suggested-action hover color

Toolbar
Search in your text editor for ! Toolbar to find the toolbar comment; change padding to 6px

Places Sidebar
* In your gtk.css file, search (Ctrl+F) for placessidebar; at the bottom, add a new background-color for lists inside of the places sidebar -> placessidebar list { background-color: #dbbb90; }
* In GTK Inspector, select the highlighted row element; note background-color location in gtk.css
* Just below, add -> placessidebar row:selected {
      border-left: 6px solid #1f1b15;
  } for a dark border along the edge of the selected list
* Search in your text editor for pathbarbox
* In that section, add a line of code to add padding around buttons and image
filechooser #pathbarbox button {
  padding: 3px 6px;
}
filechooser #pathbarbox button image {
  padding-right: 6px;
}

Notebook Paned section
* Change the paned section under the notebook widget background color to make it half
  of the saturation level
* Add under the ! Notebook section at the bottom
  notebook paned {
    background-color: #e4d1b8;
  }

Scales
* In GTK Inspector, click one of the scales with the Select an object tool
* Under CSS nodes, look for the padding in the right panel
* In gtk.css (around line 6506), change the padding for scale to 6px

Tooltip
* In your text editor, search for ! tooltip to find the tooltip section
* In the Tooltip section, remove the line border-radius: 16px; from the first style rule
* Add the following code to give rounded borders only to composited tooltip borders (denoted by the .csd class)
tooltip.background {
  border-radius: 0px;
}

tooltip.background.csd {
  border-radius: 16px;
}
